# EasySplit
Future mobile application to facilitate check-splitting in restaurants and other locations. The application is still currently in
proof-of-concept phase, with Python code to handle the basic logic and create GUI to demonstrate intended core functionality of the
application.

To use, clone the repo and obtain a free-trial of the Asprise OCR software from https://asprise.com/royalty-free-library/python-ocr-api-overview.html 

Run MainDriver.py inside app/main. Insert path to image of check to be processed (some examples provided in Images). Cycle through GUI
options to create Person objects and indicate which items were consumed by each person.

Currently, development of this project is blocked since the asprise free-trial only works for limited time. It will continue once an open
source alternative that performs well enough is found. Details in:
